# time4work

Version 1 aims
- UI with a single button
- Pressing button starts a timer
- Pressing again stops the timer
- User has clear indication when timer is running/stopped
- Total time the timer has been running on a given day is recorded in a back-end database

Research questions
- record time in UI and then send to server in chunks?
- How to send data to server back-end (back-end run using Python)?
- How to store data in server back-end Postrgres database?

1. creating basic UI/ client-side time tracking


1. working stopwatch

- pass 1 is to get it working but with innaccuracy (I.e. timer delay not guaranteed as call stack mau not be empty)
- after I build my working version I should fix this, and copy best practice from web, understanding it
